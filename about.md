    <div class="about-intro">
      <p>Hi! I'm Hina Mirza, an artist and designer from India, based in the United Kingdom. Art has always fascinated me in a variety of ways, and I have been connected to it since I was a little girl. I grew up scribbling, sketching, painting, fancying and demanding nothing but a brand new set of different colors each time on my birthday... ah the good old days!</p>

    <div class="about-body">
      <p>I graduated in Commerce, followed by a Masters in Information Technology. My connection to art grew stronger in the later phase of my life, when I decided to finally recognize it as more than just a hobby. I explored a lot of different media, until I discovered this magical medium – watercolour, and got hooked. My style is evolving in a better direction as I am able to accommodate new mediums lately.</p>

      <p>Deeply inspired by nature, my subject is mainly floral and botanical. I tend to be organic and playful with my brushstrokes, and enjoy the process without bothering much about the final outcome. Most of my artwork is digitally transformed into surface patterns and textile prints, and I find the process absolutely amazing.</p>

      <p><strong>I am mostly inclined towards sophisticated colour palettes, but open to broadening my perspective for my clients in the world of surface and textile design.</strong></p>

      <p>As a tea enthusiast, my affinity for the color green shines through in my work, a connection I'm confident is evident in my imagery.</p>

      <p>I'm currently engaged in various surface design projects spanning fabric, wallpaper and greeting cards with companies like <em>Figo Fabrics</em>, <em>Card Factory</em> and <em>Paper Culture</em>. Over the past couple of years, I've been freelance designing for <em>Pattern Collective</em> – a London-based home textile studio, honing my skills and exploring a myriad of techniques with each new design. My portfolio continues to expand, offering designs available for licensing, purchase, or bespoke commissioning.</p>

      <p>Some of my original artwork is available for sale, and I am open to creating commissioned pieces.</p>
